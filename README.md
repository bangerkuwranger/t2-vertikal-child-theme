Overriding Plugin Functions
---------------------------

The functions that can be overridden are:

*tmq_HR
*tmq_Gap
*tmq_progressbar
*tmq_review
*tmq_taglist
*tmq_services

To override a function, just write the function definition in the included file 'vertikal_addons_overrides.php'.
A rewrite of 'tmq_teammembers' is included (with original code included and commented out where necessary... you don't have to write your functions this way, but it makes it easier to update your overrides should Themique update one of the original functions) in this file as an example.
